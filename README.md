# Introduction to Attention Mechanisms in NLP

## Description
This project provides a comprehensive introduction to Attention Mechanisms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) using TensorFlow. It includes the implementation of an Attention Mechanism, an Encoder, and a Decoder within the context of a neural machine translation task. 

The code is designed to be a clear example for those looking to understand how attention can improve NLP models by allowing them to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when performing tasks like translation.

## Installation
To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:
```
git clone https://github.com/Sorena-Dev/Introduction-to-Attention-Mechanisms-in-NLP.git
```

Then, install the required packages:
```
pip install tensorflow
```

## Usage
This project can be utilized as a foundation for implementing advanced NLP models with attention mechanisms. 
For example, you can integrate the provided Attention, Encoder, and Decoder classes into a neural machine translation system to significantly improve its performance by enhancing its ability to focus on relevant parts of the input text during translation.

## Features
- Implementation of an Attention Mechanism that allows models to dynamically focus on different parts of the input sequence.
- Encoder and Decoder models that can be used as a basis for complex NLP tasks such as machine translation.
- Example usage that demonstrates how to instantiate and utilize the models with TensorFlow.
